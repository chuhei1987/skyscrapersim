# skyscrapersim
A collection of Skyscrapersim Binaries, Information and hopefully someday,
the Source

## What is this?
This is a mirror of Ryan Thoryk's Skyscraper Simulator. The project was suddenly
taken offline by him, including the source code, which is a violation of the GPL
License he chose for the program. Hopefully this source code will soon be
obtained and added to this repository.

## Version 2.0 alpha 11 on Linux
There is no currently known copy of Alpha 11 for Linux. However, the Windows
version runs fine using WINE, so if you need features from Alpha 11 you can use
this solution.

## About source code
We have read a set of code from a person, but only dated on 2017, I still need figuring how to prepare needed environment
